# Decorator

Decorator provides a way to dynamically add behavior to objects without interfering with the behavior of other objects in the same class. Decorator is useful for cleaning up the logic within views and controller in rails.

The **Draper gem** makes it essentially seamless to integrate, resulting in a more maintainable codebase that's easier to ensure full test coverage.
