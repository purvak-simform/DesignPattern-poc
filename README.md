# 1. Builder Pattern

## Definition: 
  *This pattern is often called as **Adapter**. The patternâ€™s main purpose is to provide a simple way of returning a given class or instance depending on the case*
With the help of the Builder pattern, we can construct complex objects without much effort. As we call it an Adapter, whose main purpose is to untangle the complexity of the object instantiation process.

Whenever you are dealing with a highly customized product and its complexity the Builder pattern helps to clear the clutter to create the basic concept. Because of it, one can have a fundamental understanding of complex construction.

### Employing Builder pattern
When you are creating new objects and you need many permutations of that particular feature.
When you are focused on the process of creating objects and how to assemble them, rather than being dependent on just constructors.

Real world example:- 
1. the manufacture of machinery. where production stage is different
    Assemble the body,
    Install the engine,
    Install the wheels,
    Install the interior,
    Add the electronics etc.
2. Construction of House.
